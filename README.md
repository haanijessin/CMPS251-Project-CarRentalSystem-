## Introduction

As part of Qatar's vision 2030, the government is encouraging companies to modernize their working environments. In line with this initiative, **FCars**, a car rental company, sought to transition from a paper-based system to a computerized one. This project aims to fulfill that requirement by developing a comprehensive car rental system.

## Renting Process

The renting process involves the following steps:

- **Customer Registration**: Customers, both residents and visitors, are registered in the system with their respective identification documents.
- **Deposit**: Customers are required to deposit 2000 QR for insurance purposes.
- **Rental**: Upon renting a car, an invoice is generated detailing rental charges and deposit deductions.
- **Return**: When the customer returns the car, an invoice is generated for any damages, and the remaining deposit is refunded.

## Requirement Specification

The system should facilitate the following functionalities:

1. **Customer Management**: Adding, updating, and deleting customer information.
2. **Car Management**: Adding, updating, and deleting car information.
3. **Rental Management**: Adding, updating, and deleting rental payments.
4. **Reports**: Generating reports on available cars, registered customers, rented cars, and total income.
